# Deployment — jithendar.com on mk4

**CI builds and pushes the image; `./deploy.sh` (repository root) deploys it** with `kubectl apply -k` (owner decision, 2026-10-27). Argo CD is not used for this site, and CI has no cluster access.

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Image | `881026659929.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/jithendar-com` (arm64, immutable tags = commit SHA, scan on push, last 30 kept) |
| Pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci-jithendar-com.yml`: `check` on every push/PR; on `master`, `publish` pushes `jithendar-com:<commit-sha>` |
| Deploy | `./deploy.sh [commit-sha]`, run by a person with the `mk4` kubeconfig and AWS access |
| Manifests | `deploy/base` (Deployment, Service, PDB, NetworkPolicy) + `deploy/production` (Certificate, Traefik middlewares incl. compression, Ingresses, image pin) |
| Image pulls | Secret `jithendar/ecr-pull`, refreshed every 6 h by CronJob `roboshop-ai/ecr-refresh` |
| TLS | Certificate `jithendar/jithendar-com` (apex + www, `letsencrypt-prod`) → Secret `jithendar-com-tls`. That Secret is also the Traefik default certificate (`TLSStore default`) for `/argocd`, `/grafana`, `/prometheus` and `/roboshop`. **Do not delete it.** |

## Data services (namespace `jithendar`, deployed by the same `kubectl apply -k`)

| Service | Manifest | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL 18 | `deploy/data/postgres.yaml` | StatefulSet `jithendar-postgres`, 10 GiB volume, **pinned to node `mk4-m03`** (Minikube hostpath data lives on that node; moving the pod means moving `/tmp/hostpath-provisioner/jithendar/data-jithendar-postgres-0` too). Runs as uid 70; a one-shot init container fixes volume ownership. Reachable only from the site's pods. |
| Redis 7.4 | `deploy/data/redis.yaml` | Deployment `jithendar-redis`, cache only (no persistence, 64 MB LRU), password-protected, reachable only from the site's pods. Losing it is harmless: the site falls back to Postgres. |

Secrets (never in Git), created once by `scripts/create-secrets.sh`:

| Secret | Keys |
|---|---|
| `jithendar-postgres` | `password` |
| `jithendar-redis` | `password` |
| `jithendar-com-env` | `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, `METRICS_TOKEN`, `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, optional `SMTP_URL`, `MAIL_FROM` (fallback until email is configured in the admin, see `docs/EMAIL.md`); media: `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, optional `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; optional `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` (added with `scripts/set-media-config.sh`) |

Back up `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with your database backups: it decrypts the stored storage/backup credentials.
Gemini limits (`GEMINI_IMAGE_*`) are plain env values in `deploy/base/deployment.yaml`.
Public identifiers for search engines, GA4, AdSense, ads.txt and IndexNow live in the optional ConfigMap
`jithendar-com-public` (`scripts/set-public-config.sh`; see `docs/SEO_ANALYTICS_ADS.md`). The site runs without it.
Scheduled publishing and IndexNow retries run inside the site pods (no extra workload; `docs/EDITOR.md`). Media architecture,
R2 bucket setup (CORS, lifecycle) and the S3 → R2 migration: see `docs/MEDIA.md`.

## First-time setup

1. Create a Turnstile widget for `jithendar.com` in the Cloudflare dashboard (site key + secret key).
2. `www/scripts/create-secrets.sh mk4` and keep the printed setup token.
3. `./deploy.sh` (creates Postgres and Redis, runs database migrations on start, deploys the site).
4. Open `https://jithendar.com/setup`, enter the token, and create the admin account. This also imports the existing articles and pages. `/setup` disappears once an admin exists.
5. Create the R2 bucket, CORS and lifecycle rules (`docs/MEDIA.md` → Setup), then `scripts/set-media-config.sh mk4` and restart the deployment. (Alternatively configure R2 under Admin → Storage.)

## Routing

- `https://jithendar.com/` → site. Longer path rules (`/argocd`, `/grafana`, `/prometheus`, `/roboshop`) keep priority in Traefik.
- `http://jithendar.com/*` → 308 to https (middleware `jithendar-https-redirect`).
- `http(s)://www.jithendar.com/*` → 308 to `https://jithendar.com/*` in one hop (middleware `jithendar-www-redirect`).
- Text responses are compressed by Traefik (zstd/br/gzip; middleware `jithendar-compress`).

## Release

1. Push to `master`. CI runs `check`, then `publish` builds `linux/arm64` with `GIT_SHA` baked in and pushes `jithendar-com:<commit-sha>`. The run summary prints the exact deploy command.
2. When the run is green, from the repository root:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ./deploy.sh            # the most recently pushed image
   ./deploy.sh <sha>      # a specific commit (also how you roll back)
   ```
   `deploy.sh` resolves the digest in ECR, pins it in `deploy/production/kustomization.yaml`, server dry-runs, applies, waits for the rollout (runs `rollout undo` if it fails) and runs the smoke test.
3. Commit the updated `kustomization.yaml` so Git records what is live.

Always deploy from an up-to-date checkout: `deploy.sh` applies the manifests in your working tree.

## Smoke test

```bash
www/scripts/smoke.sh https://jithendar.com [expected-commit-sha]
kubectl --context mk4 -n jithendar get certificate jithendar-com   # READY True
```

The script checks health (and version), homepage, about, RSS, both sitemaps, robots.txt, 404, the 410 hijack URLs, http→https, www→apex, and that `/argocd/` is unaffected.

## Rollback

- **Immediate:** `kubectl --context mk4 -n jithendar rollout undo deployment/jithendar-com`.
- **Lasting:** `./deploy.sh <older-commit-sha>` (any commit among the last 30 images in ECR).

## Limits

Single host: if the server goes down, the site is down. Two replicas cover pod restarts and rollouts only.
